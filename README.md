### Amethyst Project announce?

I planned to begin development of newer graphics and compute engine, with ray-tracing support. Will based on Render Graph principles, and will support both DirectX 12 Ultimate and Vulkan API 1.2 graphics API. 

Planned: 
- DirectX 12 Ultimate support, with DXR 1.1 and WDDM v2.9 support
- Vulkan API 1.2 support, with `VK_KHR_ray_tracing` extension support
- Render Graphs, even with ray-tracing and accelerated structures
- Modding and extensions support
- Official C++ modules support
- C++20 support (despite of their resistance)
- Packed geometry support
- Material managment support
- Very cool, professional, native and awesome GUI rendering (such as MC fonts, modded ImGUI...)
- ReSTIR, DLSS 2.0, VXGI 2.0, OptiX (denoise), and other technologies support...

#### Operation Systems...
- Windows 10 Update 2004 (no Vulkan API driver ready)
- Ubuntu 20.04 (current)
- Windows 10 Update 2104 (planned)
- Ubuntu 21.04 (planned)

#### Paid?

Yep! I decided that the engine, although for $3, but there must be a flagship... It will be expensive for someone, but any financial support is important to me now...
